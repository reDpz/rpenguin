- [ ] draw grid in background
    - *how are we going to do this?*
    - have a second render pipeline
    - this one just has a quad or a big tri representing the entire screen
    - colors for the grid are built into the grid shader
    - uniform buffer that passes in the position and zoom of camera
    - you can figure out how to draw the lines by yourself bro, it's just math

    - after all this, do 1 render_pass of this and after this the second render_pass is the actual particles
